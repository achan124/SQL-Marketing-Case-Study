# SQL-Marketing-Case-Study

## Overview
### Context:
This project is an exploratory analysis on marketing and e-commerce data from a synthetic dataset. The data simulates an e-commerce company’s full analytics environment, including customers, products, marketing campaigns, user interaction events, and purchase transactions.
### Goal of the Analysis:
The objective of this project is to evaluate how different campaigns contribute to conversions and customer retention. Results will help the company optimize campaign budgets and improve ROI.

## Dataset
Full dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geethasagarbonthu/marketing-and-e-commerce-analytics-dataset?select=customers.csv)
### Data Cleaning
During the initial exploration of the transactions table, I identified rows with null values in the product_id and gross_revenue columns. After checking the count of null values in each, it appears that all null gross_revenue values occur when product_id is also null, confirming that missing revenue is tied to missing products.

**Possible Explanation**
1. **Deleted or missing product reference**
  - The product may not be sold anymore and has been deleted in the products table, but the transaction was not updated.
2. **Revenue is dependent on product_id**
  - Revenue can only be calculated if there is an associated product_id as the base_price is only included in the product table

**Conclusion:**
I chose to include these rows to account for all transactions and ensure completeness of the dataset. I handled the missing data by filling them in with default values. Null values in product_id and gross_revenue are now shown as 0.
